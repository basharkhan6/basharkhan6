I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering ðŸ’» with a passion for the Java[![Java Icon](https://imgur.com/download/h3Yx8Yv/")](https://www.oracle.com/java) ecosystem, Spring[![Spring Icon](https://imgur.com/download/L0dwAuB/)](https://spring.io), REST APIs, and, of course, security.
Recently I have finished [Web Quiz Engine](https://github.com/basharkhan6/Web_Quiz_Engine) Project. You find all of my work in [GitHub](https://github.com/basharkhan6) and [Codepen](https://codepen.io/basharkhan6/pens/showcase)(Front-End)
Nowadays, Iâ€™m focusing ![Focus Icon](https://imgur.com/download/GKpyw6O/) on my final year projectðŸ’». Soon It will be publish in my repo.

I'm generally hangging around on [Twitter ![Twitter Icon](https://imgur.com/download/qM5Sqse/)](https://twitter.com/bashar_khan6).
